- **Show bets**: Lowest risk/reward - pays for top 3 finishers

### Example Betting Scenarios

```clarity
;; Conservative Strategy - Multiple show bets
(place-bet u1 u0 u200 "show")  ;; Racer 0 to finish top 3
(place-bet u1 u1 u200 "show")  ;; Racer 1 to finish top 3  
(place-bet u1 u2 u200 "show")  ;; Racer 2 to finish top 3

;; Aggressive Strategy - High win bet on favorite
(place-bet u1 u3 u1500 "win")  ;; All-in on racer 3 to win

;; Balanced Strategy - Mixed bet types
(place-bet u1 u0 u500 "win")    ;; Win bet on favorite
(place-bet u1 u1 u300 "place")  ;; Place bet on second choice
(place-bet u1 u4 u200 "show")   ;; Show bet on longshot
